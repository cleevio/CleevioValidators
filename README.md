# CleevioValidators

CleevioValidators is a Swift package that provides a collection of reusable validators to validate various types of content and the validator interface.

## Features

CleevioValidators includes the following validators:

- `BoolValidator`: validates if a value is an expected boolean
- `EmailFormatValidator`: validates if a value is a valid email format.
- `MinimumCharactersValidator`: validates if a string has a minimum number of characters.
- `MinimumCollectionCountValidator`: validates if a collection has a minimum number of items.
- `NonNilValidator`: validates if a value is not nil.

All validators implement the `ValidatorType` protocol, which defines a `validate` method that takes a value of any type and returns am optional error indicating whether the value is valid or not.

In addition, you can create custom validators by conforming to the `ValidatorType` protocol and implementing the `validate` method. This allows you to create validators specific to your project's needs.

The library is fully documented and fully covered by tests.

## Installation
